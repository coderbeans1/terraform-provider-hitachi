# hitachi_vsp_volume (Resource)

The following request creates a volume by using the specified parity groups or pools. Specify a parity group or pool id for creating a basic volume.

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "hitachi_vsp_volume" "mylun" {
  serial  = 40014
  size_gb = 1
  pool_id = 1
}

/*
hitachi_vsp_volume.mylun: Creating...
hitachi_vsp_volume.mylun: Creation complete after 4s [id=226]

Apply complete! Resources: 1 added, 0 changed, 0 destroyed.
*/

# resource "hitachi_vsp_volume" "mylun_parity" {
#   serial         = 40014
#   size_gb        = 1
#   paritygroup_id = "1-1"
#   dedup_mode     = "compression"
# }
